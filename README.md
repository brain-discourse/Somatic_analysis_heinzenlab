# Somatic_analysis_heinzenlab
2020-2021- somatic analysis of exome sequencing data 
this project analyzed whole exome sequencing data using mutect2 to detect potential pathogenic somatic mutations in patient samples. the patient samples were surgically resected brain cortical tissues.
I developed an annotation pipeline, did joint genotyping for germline variants, QC for all samples, optimized a CNV caller and help with analysis of somatic variants
