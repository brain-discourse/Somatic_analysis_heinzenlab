2020-2021- somatic analysis of exome sequencing data \

this project analyzed whole exome sequencing data using mutect2 to detect potential pathogenic somatic mutations in patient samples. The patient samples were surgically resected brain cortical tissues.
This repo contains the pipeline for annotation, joint genotyping for germline variants, QC, and CNV calling.
